The expert system will advise students regarding what course the student should select for their Masters studies. The expert system will gather information like undergraduate Score, academic interests, career plans, etc. of a student along with course details like cost, course credits, research, etc. Using this information and a set of rules, our expert system suggests the student with the course title. CLIPS software is used to implement this.
